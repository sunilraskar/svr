 ETL framework would be a centerpiece to implement the business data 
strategies. It will be essentially next generation ETL framework which 
would pull data from various sources (structure/unstructured data), 
reshaping it, applying business rules, loading to the appropriate 
destinations, and validating the results using analytics and dashboard. 
The modern framework must have a number core architectural principles 
Which includes -</p><p id="9e2a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Any
 solution designed and developed using this new framework should not be a
 patch work of legacy and modern systems, abandoned and duplicate work 
which cause setback in business</p><p id="b1c4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">The
 ETL framework must be first class high speed in loading volume data — 
Companies have been investing significantly in building next-generation 
platforms and products using new technologies. So, it is at most import 
that framework delivery high performance otherwise it led to disruption 
in services and can profoundly impact the brand image, customer loyalty,
 and revenue.</p><p id="4551" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">The
 framework must be highly Scalable — There should be a single point of 
failure. The Framework must able install on more than one node so that 
there is no down time. It should allow increase or decrease (Scale 
Up/Scale Down) the concurrent Data movement at each node job.</p><p id="6a0e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">It
 is a well-known fact that any standardization positively impacts the 
business. Similarly, the framework must enforce writing same code with 
consistent standards and the standard must be well established in the 
industry so that supporting the code is not nightmare which will ensure 
smooth functioning of software programs and is vital for the success of 
most organizations.</p><p id="2f60" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">The
 framework dataload state must not have scheduling problems which lead 
to inefficiency by either not producing high-quality results. It should 
allow data state scheduling which help efficiently large designs with 
complex flow with simple design.</p><p id="4e09" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">The
 framework error Handling must be robust. If a program cannot 
successfully do what it is designed to do an exception should be thrown 
and systems should maintain the state so that users can work from the 
point of failure onward which will help organizations to develop ELT 
solutions in budget and time.</p><p id="a0ea" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Essentially, ETL framework should provide organizations with the same outcome when implemented through out company.</p><h1 id="e280" class="yi yj wr gu yk yl ym yn lr yo yp yq ls lt yr lu lv lw ys lx ly lz yt ma mb yu hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Overview of the ETL framework Components.</h1><p id="48a8" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn yv xp xq xr yw xt xu xv yx xx xy xz yy yb yc yd yz yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">The framework must have following four type of components.</p><h1 id="8211" class="yi yj wr gu yk yl ym yn lr yo yp yq ls lt yr lu lv lw ys lx ly lz yt ma mb yu hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Connect and collect</h1><p id="3dd4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn yv xp xq xr yw xt xu xv yx xx xy xz yy yb yc yd yz yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Enterprises
 have data of various types that are in disparate sources on-premises, 
in the cloud, structured, unstructured, and semi-structured, all 
arriving at different intervals and speeds. Therefore, the framework 
must have built in components to design the first step in the ETL 
solution.</p><p id="6447" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">The
 framework allows connect to all the required sources of data and 
processing, such as software-as-a-service (SaaS) services, databases, 
file shares, and FTP web services.</p><p id="61ee" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">The next step in an ETL process is to move the data as needed to a centralized location for subsequent processing.</p><p id="0281" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Without
 the ETL framework, enterprises build custom data movement components or
 write custom services to integrate these data sources and processing 
which is expensive and hard to integrate and maintain such systems. In 
addition, they often lack the enterprise-grade monitoring, alerting, and
 the controls that a fully managed service can offer.</p><p id="2b08" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">With the ETL framework, you have components like <a class="ey dh" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/copy-activity-overview" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Copy Activity</a>
 in a data pipeline to move data from both on-premises and cloud source 
data stores to a centralization data store in the cloud for further 
analysis. For example, in Data factory you can collect data in Azure 
Data Lake Store and transform the data later by using an Azure Data Lake
 Analytics compute service.</p><h1 id="a5c2" class="yi yj wr gu yk yl ym yn lr yo yp yq ls lt yr lu lv lw ys lx ly lz yt ma mb yu hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Transform and enrich</h1><p id="2134" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn yv xp xq xr yw xt xu xv yx xx xy xz yy yb yc yd yz yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">After
 data is present in a centralized data store in the cloud, you need to 
components to reliable transformations the data to produce transformed 
data on a maintainable and controlled schedule to feed production 
environments with trusted data.</p><h1 id="ef66" class="yi yj wr gu yk yl ym yn lr yo yp yq ls lt yr lu lv lw ys lx ly lz yt ma mb yu hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Publish</h1><p id="1ad3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn yv xp xq xr yw xt xu xv yx xx xy xz yy yb yc yd yz yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">After
 the raw data has been refined you need components so publish it so that
 data is business-ready consumable form and available in popular data 
warehouse such as Azure Data Warehouse, Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos
 DB, or whichever analytics engine your business users can point to from
 their business intelligence tools.</p><h1 id="8873" class="yi yj wr gu yk yl ym yn lr yo yp yq ls lt yr lu lv lw ys lx ly lz yt ma mb yu hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Monitor</h1><p id="7c05" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn yv xp xq xr yw xt xu xv yx xx xy xz yy yb yc yd yz yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">After
 you have successfully built and deployed your data integration 
pipeline, providing business value from refined data, monitoring the 
scheduled activities is so important. So, the framework must have 
built-in components which support pipeline monitoring via Azure Monitor,
 API, PowerShell, Log Analytics, and health panels on the Azure portal.</p><h1 id="7032" class="yi yj wr gu yk yl ym yn lr yo yp yq ls lt yr lu lv lw ys lx ly lz yt ma mb yu hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Recommended Platforms &amp; Technologies.</h1><p id="087e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn yv xp xq xr yw xt xu xv yx xx xy xz yy yb yc yd yz yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">I
 recommend Azure Data Factory ETL platform. The Azure Data Factory ETL 
framework has all the modern ETL framework features that we discussed 
above However, there are various other capabilities that organizations 
often look for when selecting a solution for ETL. The table below 
summarizes these “success” capabilities, and shows how Azure Data 
Factory Platform fulfils them:</p><p id="d3d0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="xm kr">Success capability</strong></p><p id="54e9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="xm kr">How Data Factory Platform fulfills the capability</strong></p><p id="e235" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Source Control for CI/CD pipeline</p><p id="e6b9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Organization
 are getting into rapid release cycle for the product and services. So, 
the framework source code should be in git repository so that business 
can apply continuous integration and deployment strategy and deploy ETL 
workflows to multiple environment such as Dev, Test, Prod and more.</p><p id="87cf" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Data enrichment</p><p id="412f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">With
 ADF Platform, users can embed API calls or use direct look up on 
external data source via connectors to retrieve data. They can then use 
Data aggregate transformation capabilities to enrich the data being 
processed by the batch process</p><p id="861f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Data quality</p><p id="0fa5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Users
 can also embed API calls or connectors to call an external data quality
 service. For example, an app may receive the state code as California, 
CA, or Calif in the records; so, to consistently represent the state 
code as CA users can invoke a data quality API that is custom or 
provided by a third-party to ensure data consistency and quality.</p><p id="060d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Data validation</p><p id="4e64" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">ADF
 provides a few options for data validation, this includes a 
“validations component” that can validate simple values (e.g. emails, 
numbers, etc.), as well as a “JSON schema validator” and an “XML schema 
validator.”</p><p id="63a4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Cloud and hybrid</p><p id="87fe" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Organizations
 have a wide variety of modern and legacy applications, which is why 
they need to have flexible deployment options. The platform should be 
able to connect to SaaS and on-prem applications, as well as act as an 
integration-platform-as-a-service (iPaaS) to</p><p id="ae58" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Alternately,
 I recommend Mule Soft AnyPoint or Alteryx platform. Mule Soft is 
specialize in providing ETL cloud services whereas Alteryx specializes 
in self-service analytics with an intuitive user interface. There are 
several features both Mule Soft and Alteryx ETL framework has:</p><ul class=""><li id="ee04" class="mz za wr xm b xn xo xr xs xv zb xz zc yd zd yh ze zf zg lh hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Alteryx is official Microsoft partner for Azure Data Warehouse solution's.</li><li id="be40" class="mz za wr xm b xn zh xr zi xv zj xz zk yd zl yh ze zf zg lh hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Mule Soft Anypoit platform has unquiet feature called Data aggregate which business can use for incremental dimensional load.</li><li id="e634" class="mz za wr xm b xn zh xr zi xv zj xz zk yd zl yh ze zf zg lh hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Multiple
 data sources: Using both framework users can analyze data from many 
sources including spreadsheets, cloud or on-premise data stores, AWS,

 Input phase: The objective of this phase is to load data that will be 
processed by the Dataload Job. This is typically achieved using The 
NextGenDataload Connectors, which should be pre-build connector for 
example text file, SQL Database, App Connector. The data is then loaded 
onto a persistent disk to ensure processing if a failure occurs.</p><p id="e5a7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">2.
 Load and dispatch phase: This phase is implicit (i.e. batch process 
developers do not have access to this phase). The objective of this 
phase is to divide loaded data from the input phase into individual 
records, then distribute it for further processing via a persistent 
message queue.</p><p id="1fd2" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">3.
 Process phase: This phase consists of one or more batch steps. A batch 
step is a sequence of message processors that individually process each 
record in the batch from the persistent queue — loaded during the load 
and dispatch phase. Steps in this phase include transforming data before
 updating, inserting data into another application, enriching data via 
API calls, etc.</p><p id="0463" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn xo xp xq xr xs xt xu xv xw xx xy xz ya yb yc yd ye yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">4.
 Completion phase: This is the final phase, and it is typically used to 
provide a summary report on the batch process. Teams can also use this 
phase to perform post-processing steps, such as cleaning up data, 
sending notifications to initiate new processes, etc.</p><h1 id="f9f8" class="yi yj wr gu yk yl ym yn lr yo yp yq ls lt yr lu lv lw ys lx ly lz yt ma mb yu hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Conclusion</h1><p id="c846" class="pw-post-body-paragraph xk xl wr xm b xn yv xp xq xr yw xt xu xv yx xx xy xz yy yb yc yd yz yf yg yh wd hf" data-selectable-paragraph="">The
 reality is that most organizations have a wide variety of modern and 
legacy systems that hold valuable data. To tap into that information and
 further data-driven decision making, many organizations turn to ETL 
solutions; however, many organizations are facing setbacks because 
traditional approaches to implementing ETL solution create a patch work 
of legacy and modern systems, abandoned code, and duplicate work. 
Therefore, some organizations are turning to a new ELT platform and 
Organization are moving to Azure Data Factory, Mule Soft or Alteryx to 
implement these capabilities.</p>
